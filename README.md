## Laravel Example

*Note: Work in progress. Check out alternative example here: https://github.com/camuthig/proophessor-do-laravel*

"Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects"

With that in mind, we want to give the power of prooph and it's production ready CQRS/ES features to Laravel.

This project is just a simple example of how to use prooph with Laravel using the `prooph/laravel-package`.
